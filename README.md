# COLLABORATIVE-WORKSPACE-IN-VR
The main objective of the project is to explore the possibilities the Unity framework allows in terms of developing multiple-party VR software. In that optic, we developed a collaborative interior design workspace in virtual reality. Interior design students benefit from this experience since it introduces elements that we canâ€™t have in the real world. For instance, moving furniture with a controller, or painting walls instantly with no extra cost.
